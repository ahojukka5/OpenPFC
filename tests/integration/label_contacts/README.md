# Fresh known-UID label contacts

`label_contacts` scans a slot-major padded image whose nonzero labels already
represent complete persistent UID support. It neither thresholds amplitudes nor
propagates identity. The caller must pack the accepted state and complete a
**Full** halo exchange covering the chosen radius before publishing its generation
tag. A timestep's midpoint halo is insufficient. Tags reject stale metadata;
they cannot prove that a caller actually refreshed the image.

The probe compares distinct labels within the same slot and returns compact
owned support counts and a proximity flag. A flag permits on-demand all-slot
exact adjacency extraction. Cross-slot overlap at the same cell creates an edge
but does not itself trigger a same-slot collision. Six connectivity uses a
Manhattan ball; TwentySix uses a Chebyshev cube. Physical nonperiodic exterior
cells are excluded; periodic and decomposition corners come from Full halos.

The collective trigger votes producer failures before reducing flags and checks
radius/generation/scanned field-count agreement. It is not a global UID-admission or retirement
operation. `prepare_contacts` requires full edges, validates the canonical
strictly increasing registry and partition coverage, gathers only owned counts
and edges, then reuses the existing global resolver. `stage` and `transfer_signed`
retain the existing all-rank transaction and support negative and UID-owned zero
amplitudes. Touching same-slot supports already within radius one fail with
`UnsafeCadence`; the producer must detect early enough for its evolution stencil.
The caller supplies the required safety radius; this API does not infer it from
physics or RK stage count.

Both uint64 labels and exact-integer double labels are supported. Double labels
must lie in [0, 2^53]. Unknown UID, incorrect slot, noncanonical registry,
insufficient/Faces/stale halos and bounded edge overflow fail explicitly. No
conservative-bounds fallback is selected automatically.

`ContactWorkspace<Backend>` owns fixed-registry device buffers; reconstruct it
after any registry/slot change. Workspace-backed probes/extraction allocate no
device buffers; host compact result vectors still allocate and calls synchronize.
The convenience overload constructs scratch on every call. Probe scratch is
O(grains), extraction reserves an O(grains squared) device matrix plus bounded
edge storage and uses serial canonical packing. The literal neighbor loop costs
O(owned cells * slots * radius cubed), and full extraction adds another slot
factor. These are correctness capabilities, not established performance claims.
The workspace is non-reentrant, privately owns its registry and buffers, and
rejects moved-from scratch before any launch.

The executable fixtures use an independent global coordinate-pair oracle and
real host/device Full halo exchange on 1/2/4/8 ranks. Cases distinguish same-slot
face/diagonal/seam flags from cross-slot same-cell edges, exercise disconnected
support, physical boundary poison, capacity failures, stale/incomplete images,
signed remapping and all-rank rejection. Native tests require actual HIP
hardware; compilation alone does not verify execution. Small field downloads
in native unit tests inspect transactional outputs; producers never download the
padded label volume.

Run the canonical `scripts/build.sh --cpu --no-heffte --mpi-tests` or HIP variant.
CTest registrations are `LabelContacts`, `LabelContacts_{1,2,4,8}ranks`, and
`HIP_LabelContacts_{1,2,4,8}ranks` when HIP and MPI suites are enabled. These tests
establish software correctness, not physical model validity or device scaling.
