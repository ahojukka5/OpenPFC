 * @brief Shipped preset and the thresholds that keep it honest.
 *
 * The preset moved in 0.2 from `64^2, dt=9e-5, eps=0.19, F=10` to the values
 * below, for two coupled reasons measured in
 * `out/report/data/allen_cahn_resolution_margin.csv`:
 *
 * 1. **The old interface was sub-grid.** `eps*sqrt(2M) = 0.76` cells, so the
 *    front was pinned by the lattice rather than set by the continuum
 *    physics. Against the curvature-corrected sharp-interface law it ran
 *    `-32%` slow at a comfortable driving force.
 * 2. **The old driving force was 6% under the bistability ceiling** — and
 *    that was load-bearing, not incidental. Backing `F` off at
 *    `eps = 0.19` walks the error from `+17%` (at the ceiling) to `-65%` (a
 *    quarter of it): at a 0.76-cell interface the *only* driving force that
 *    reproduces the continuum law is one so large that the double well has
 *    almost stopped being a double well. The margin cannot be fixed on its
 *    own; the resolution has to be fixed first.
 *
 * At `eps = 0.75` the interface is 3.0 cells wide, `F` sits a factor 2.7
 * under the ceiling, and the measured `dR/dt` matches the curvature-corrected
 * law to 2.3% on every grid from `128^2` to `512^2`.
