# Yang 2015 design A3 geometry note (OpenPFC #43)

Primary source: Yang, Harrysson, West & Cormier, *Int. J. Solids
Struct.* 69–70 (2015) 475–490,
DOI [10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.05.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.05.005).

Li Yang's dissertation §3.2.1 is used only to confirm unit-cell
topology (alternating 2-D layers, half-cell shift). It is not a
parameter source.

Wang, Li & Ma, *Mater. Des.* 99 (2016) 467–476, eq. (4) is an
independent density oracle for the same topology. It is not used to
change \(H\), \(L\), \(\theta\), or \(t\).

## Frozen A3 numbers (Yang Table 1)

Verified from the primary paper before any OpenPFC Poisson evaluation:

| symbol | value | role |
|--------|-------|------|
| \(\theta\) | \(45^\circ\) | angle between a **vertical** strut and a **re-entrant** strut |
| \(H\) | 7.74 mm | vertical strut length |
| \(L\) | 3.78 mm | re-entrant (oblique) strut length |
| \(H/L\) | 2.05 | Yang reports 2.05; \(7.74/3.78 = 2.0476\ldots\) |
| \(t\) | 0.80 mm | square-section side |
| \(\bar\rho\) | 23.30 % | published relative density |
| \(\nu_{zx}\) | \(-1.90\) | theoretical sign/mechanism; **not** a voxel fit target |

Constraints used by the same topology (Wang): \(2 L \cos\theta < H\)
and \(t < L \sin\theta\). For A3 both hold:
\(2 L \cos 45^\circ = 5.346 < 7.74\), \(t = 0.80 < 2.673\).

## Unit-cell box (Yang §4.1.2)

The geometrical bounding box of the unit cell is

\[
2(H - L\cos\theta) \times 2 L \sin\theta \times 2 L \sin\theta.
\]

For A3 that is \(L_x = L_y = 5.346\,\mathrm{mm}\),
\(L_z = 10.134\,\mathrm{mm}\), \(L_z/L_x = 1.896\).

The first implementation used \(L_z = H + 2 L\cos\theta = 13.086\,\mathrm{mm}\)
(outward convex V's, one story). That box is **not** Yang's.

## Topology

- Build the 3-D network from 2-D re-entrant bowties in the \(x z\) and
  \(y z\) planes.
- Re-entrant V's fold **inward** (waist between the ends of \(H\)).
- Adjacent parallel layers are shifted by half a cell in-plane
  (\(L_x/2\) or \(L_y/2\)).
- Each 2-D layer family has two \(z\)-stories offset by
  \(H-2L\cos\theta\), so a layer contains a column of \(H\) members
  (the 2-D honeycomb column). That is not the #36 surrogate of
  through-going pillars on every half-lattice point.
- Verticals of adjacent layers are **not** collinear. A through-going
  pillar along the full \(L_z\) at one \((x,y)\) is a different
  surrogate (OpenPFC #36).
- Wang's unit-cell drawing counts 4 verticals and 16 obliques. After
  periodic identification of opposite faces the unique skeleton has 2
  \(H\) columns (one per story) and 16 \(L\) members.

## Cross section

Yang: "thickness of the strut cross section \(t\)". Wang (same
topology) uses a square of side \(t\) on every member. Occupancy is
the square prism of half-width \(t/2\) in the local frame of the
segment, **not** the Euclidean tube \(\sqrt{d^2} \le t/2\).

## Density oracles (before elasticity)

- Published Table 1: \(0.233\).
- Wang eq. (4) overlap-corrected: \(\approx 0.165\) for A3.
- Predeclared voxel gate, frozen before Poisson:
  \(\varphi \in [0.113, 0.353]\) (half to 1.5 times published).
- Do **not** thicken \(t\) to hit 0.233.

The 0.089 solid fraction of job 22159982 is the first skeleton
(wrong \(L_z\), one story, cylinders). It is not a faithful
Yang-model failure.

## Resolutions (frozen by \(t/L_x\), not by Poisson)

\(t/L_x = 0.150\). 32³ gives \(\approx 4.8\) voxels across \(t\)
(too coarse). Pair:

- \(64 \times 64 \times 121\) (\(\approx 9.6\) voxels across \(t\))
- \(96 \times 96 \times 182\)

\(N_z = \mathrm{round}(N_x L_z/L_x)\).
