# Magnetic-island coalescence (issue #113)

Stage-0 qualification of a doubly-periodic coalescence control for
the accepted Orszag–Tang persistent-X result. Parent research work
order: .

This note freezes the benchmark, the perturbation, and — after the
\(\eta=0.01\) run — the cross-\(\eta\) event statistic. It does
**not** run \(\eta=0.005\), fit a scaling exponent, add noise, hunt
plasmoids, or add Hall/kinetic physics.

The solver is unchanged. Topology, flux-budget, and local-sheet
definitions are the accepted #26/#38 machinery.

## Literature-matched field

Ng & Ragunathan (arXiv:1106.0521) use, on the unit square,

\[
A(x,y,0)=\bar A\sin(2\pi x)\sin(2\pi y),\qquad \bar A=0.4.
\]

On OpenPFC's \([0,2\pi]^2\) domain the coordinate-equivalent flux is

\[
a(x,y,0)=0.4\sin x\sin y.
\]

Then \(j=-\nabla^2 a=2a\), so \(\mathbf B\cdot\nabla j=0\). With
\(u=0\) the magnetic field is an exact static state of the current
vorticity formulation; it decays only as the \(k^2=2\) resistive
eigenmode \(a(t)=a(0)e^{-2\eta t}\).

Critical points of \(a\):

| kind | locations | \(a\) |
|------|-----------|------:|
| X | \((0,0)\), \((\pi,0)\), \((0,\pi)\), \((\pi,\pi)\) | \(0\) |
| \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\) | \((\pi/2,\pi/2)\), \((3\pi/2,3\pi/2)\) | \(+0.4\) |
| \(\mathrm{O}_{\min}\) | \((\pi/2,3\pi/2)\), \((3\pi/2,\pi/2)\) | \(-0.4\) |

Like-signed islands sit on the diagonals. Magnetic separatrices of
the \(a=0\) network are the coordinate axes, not the Morse
diagonals (already tested on \(a=\sin x\sin y\)).

Tracked **primary family**: the X nearest \((\pi,\pi)\) and the
enclosed \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\) nearest \((\pi/2,\pi/2)\). At \(t=0\),
\(F=a_O-a_X=0.4\). The negative pair that coalesces toward
\((0,0)\) is the symmetry image and is not a second experiment.

## Frozen perturbation

Ng & Ragunathan state that a small flow triggers the coalescence
instability but do not give its form in the short paper. Random
noise is forbidden in the accepted baseline.

The smallest deterministic, divergence-free, low-wavenumber
streamfunction that displaces like-signed islands toward one
another is the \(k=1\) diagonal strain

\[
\phi=\varepsilon(\cos x-\cos y),\qquad
\varepsilon=0.01\ \text{(frozen)}.
\]

Then

\[
\mathbf u=(\varepsilon\sin y,\ \varepsilon\sin x),\qquad
\omega=\varepsilon(\cos x-\cos y).
\]

Direction check, \(\varepsilon>0\):

- \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}(\pi/2,\pi/2)\): \(\mathbf u=\varepsilon(1,1)\)
  toward \((\pi,\pi)\).
- \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}(3\pi/2,3\pi/2)\): \(\mathbf u=\varepsilon(-1,-1)\)
  toward \((\pi,\pi)\).
- \(\mathrm{O}_{\min}(\pi/2,3\pi/2)\): \(\mathbf u=\varepsilon(-1,1)\)
  toward \((0,0)\).
- \(\mathrm{O}_{\min}(3\pi/2,\pi/2)\): \(\mathbf u=\varepsilon(1,-1)\)
  toward \((0,0)\).
- All four X-points are stagnation points.

This is not \(\phi\propto a\) (which stagnates at the O-points) and
not a single Fourier mode (which only translates the lattice). The
shape and amplitude are frozen during Stage 0 and are **not**
retuned with \(\eta\). Constants live in
`include/ns2d/mhd_cases.hpp` as `coalescence_abar` and
`coalescence_eps`.

Stage-0 parameters: \(\nu=\eta=0.01\), \(P_m=1\).

## Diagnostics (unchanged definitions)

Reuse `scripts/mhd_topology.py`, `island_flux_budget.py`,
`mhd_sheet_geometry.py`, and `sheet_scaling.py`:

- Fourier sub-grid X/O tracker;
- magnetic separatrix / enclosure;
- \(F=a_O-a_X\);
- \(E_{z,X}=-\mathrm{d}a_X/\mathrm{d}t\);
- \(\eta j_X\) Ohm check;
- X/O flux budget;
- signed-current-ridge sheet frame;
- connected-component \(\delta\) and \(L\);
- spectral \(B_{\mathrm{up}}\);
- \(S_{\mathrm{local}}=L B_{\mathrm{up}}/\eta\);
- \(R=|E_{z,X}|/B_{\mathrm{up}}^2\);
- Hessian-conditioning and Elsasser-CFL fail-closed gates.

Do not use \(\max|j|\) as a reconnection proxy. Pass
`--family coalescence` so the tracker seeds \((\pi,\pi)\) rather
than the OT \(a\approx-0.5\) island.

## Cross-\(\eta\) event statistic (corrected and frozen before Stage 1)

The first Stage-0 draft used raw island-flux progress

\[
p_F=(F(0)-F(t))/|F(0)|,\qquad F=a_O-a_X.
\]

That is **not** a valid cross-\(\eta\) event coordinate for this
benchmark. The unperturbed magnetic field is a resistive eigenmode, so
\(a_O\) and therefore \(F\) decay even when the X-point electric field
is zero. At \(\eta=0.01\), pure eigenmode decay alone gives
\(1-e^{-2\eta t}\approx0.165\) by the first \`sheet_ok\` time
\(t=9.032\). The previously proposed \(p_F\in[0.30,0.60]\) bracket
is therefore **withdrawn as a cross-resistivity comparator before any
\(\eta=0.005\) run**.

The corrected progress coordinate is cumulative flux transferred
through the tracked X-point,

\[
\Psi_X(t)=\int_0^t E_z(X,t')\,dt'=a_X(0)-a_X(t),
\]

and

\[
p_X(t)=s_X\frac{\Psi_X(t)}{|F(0)|},
\]

where \(s_X\) is the sign of \(E_z(X)\) at the first finite-sheet
dump. A pure O-mode resistive decay with \(a_X=0\) therefore has
\(p_X=0\) even while \(F\) changes substantially. A synthetic test
requires exactly this control.

The frozen Stage-1 comparator is

\[
p_X\in[0.05,0.10].
\]

These numbers were fixed after identifying the diffusion contamination
in the original Stage-0 statistic and **before** any \(\eta=0.005\)
run. They represent 5--10% of the initial island flux transferred
through the X-point, not 5--10% of total island-flux decay. The event
is additionally required to be entirely \`sheet_ok\`; if the upper
bound is not reached after a finite sheet forms, the run fails closed.

Rebound/sloshing is detected from a persistent sign reversal of
\(E_z(X)\), not from \(dF/dt\), because the latter also contains
O-point diffusion.

Later runs report on this frozen X-flux interval:

| quantity | definition |
|----------|------------|
| mean \(R\) | time mean of \(|E_{z,X}|/B_{\mathrm{up}}^2\) |
| mean \(S_{\mathrm{local}}\) | time mean of \(L B_{\mathrm{up}}/\eta\) |
| mean \(\delta/L\) | time mean of connected-component aspect |
| mean \(j_X\) | time mean of spectral \(j\) at the tracked X |
| mean \(L\) | time mean of connected-component length |
| mean \(B_{\mathrm{up}}\) | time mean of spectral upstream field |
| flux pile-up | \(B_{\mathrm{up}}^{\max}/B_{\mathrm{up}}(t_{\mathrm{first}})\) on the event window |
| sloshing sentinel | first persistent \(E_z(X)\) reversal, or none |

Peak reconnection rate remains secondary. A two-point log--log slope
is out of scope for Stage 1.

### Frozen numbers after the correction

| symbol | value | status |
|--------|------:|--------|
| \(\varepsilon\) | \(0.01\) | frozen before any run |
| \(\bar A\) | \(0.4\) | literature match |
| \(p_{X,\mathrm{lo}}\) | \(0.05\) | frozen before \(\eta=0.005\) |
| \(p_{X,\mathrm{hi}}\) | \(0.10\) | frozen before \(\eta=0.005\) |
| raw \(p_F\in[0.30,0.60]\) | withdrawn | diffusion-contaminated; history only |
| event clock window | n/a | not used as the comparator |

## Qualification ladder

Start at \(128^2\) and \(256^2\). Timestep refinement at \(256^2\)
(`--cfl 0.4` vs `0.2`). Increase \(N\) only if a concrete
convergence failure requires it.

Demonstrate:

1. analytic \(t=0\) topology;
2. intended islands approach and coalesce;
3. one unambiguous primary X/O family;
4. X/O topology survives refinement;
5. \(E_{z,X}\approx\eta j_X\);
6. island-flux budget closes;
7. \(\delta\), \(L\), and \(B_{\mathrm{up}}\) finite and
   `sheet_ok`;
8. the same event spatially and timestep converged;
9. representative \(j+a\) contours + X/O frames preserved.

## Commands

`--steps` above reaches \(t\approx 40\) at each nominal CFL. Shorten
only after the scout shows that the first coalescence and any first
rebound both sit well below that time.

### Ladder

1. **t=0 topology.** Four X, two \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\), two
   \(\mathrm{O}_{\min}\). Tracked family: X nearest \((\pi,\pi)\),
   enclosed \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\) nearest \((\pi/2,\pi/2)\),
   \(F(0)=0.40000\). Analytic test in
   `scripts/test_mhd_topology.py`. Frame:
   `figures/coalescence/ic256_t0.png`.
2. **Islands approach and coalesce.** The \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\)
   walks along the diagonal toward the stationary X at
   \((\pi,\pi)\): at \(t=0\), \((x_O,y_O)\approx(1.57,1.57)\); at
   first `sheet_ok`, \(\approx(1.66,1.66)\); by \(t\approx 40\),
   \(\approx(2.67,2.67)\). \(F: 0.400\to 0.031\) (\(p\approx 0.92\)).
3. **One primary family.** The tracker holds the \((\pi,\pi)\) X
   and its enclosed \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\) through the run.
   Hessian \(\mathrm{cond}(X)\) at \(t=0\) is 1.
4. **Topology survives refinement.** At matched times, \(F(t)\)
   and the event means agree among 128² CFL 0.4, 256² CFL 0.4, and
   256² CFL 0.2 to relative \(\sim 10^{-11}\). The X coordinate
   differs by half a cell (stationary saddle at \(\pi\)); that
   does not move the scalars. No 512² run is required.
5. **Ohm.** On 256² CFL 0.4,
   \(\mathrm{rms}(E_{z,X}-\eta j_X)=1.86\times 10^{-6}\).
6. **Flux budget.** Identity
   \(\mathrm{rms}(\mathrm{d}F/\mathrm{d}t-(E_{z,X}-E_{z,O}))
   =1.8\times 10^{-17}\). Resistive residual
   \(\mathrm{rms}(\mathrm{d}F/\mathrm{d}t-\eta(j_X-j_O))
   =2.0\times 10^{-6}\).
7. **Sheet.** First \`sheet_ok\` at \(t=9.032\),
   \(\delta\approx 0.45\), \(L\approx 1.00\),
   \(B_{\mathrm{up}}\approx 0.23\). The old raw-\(F\) progress there
   was \(p_F\approx0.189\), but that number is retained only as a
   diffusion-contaminated diagnostic. Cross-\(\eta\) alignment uses
   \(p_X\), defined above.
8. **Scalar/timestep convergence.** The previously reported
   raw-\(F\)-window means (mean \(R=0.1404\),
   \(S_{\mathrm{local}}=17.15\), \(\delta/L=0.4385\),
   \(j_X=-0.4062\), \(L=0.9773\), \(B_{\mathrm{up}}=0.1767\))
   remain useful Stage-0 diagnostics, but are **withdrawn as the
   cross-resistivity statistic** because the window coordinate was
   diffusion-contaminated. Their 128²/256² and CFL 0.4/0.2 agreement
   remains a scalar/timestep check.
9. **Field-level spatial gate.** Scalar agreement alone is not used to
   admit the spatial step. \`compare_mhd_fields.py\` restricts 256²
   Fourier fields onto the 128² common band at two exactly matched
   times: \(t=9.032078879\) (increments 460/920) and
   \(t=15.707963268\) (increments 800/1600). The fail-closed
   \`coalescence_field_gate.py\` requires relative \(L^2\) errors
   \(<10^{-5}\) for \(a\) and \(<10^{-3}\) for \(j\),
   \(\omega\), magnetic-energy spectrum, current spectrum and
   enstrophy spectrum. **Stage 1 remains forbidden until this raw-data
   gate is executed and recorded.**
10. **Frames.** \`figures/coalescence/\`: \(t=0\), first \`sheet_ok\`,
   mid-transfer and the \(F(t)\) / O-path series. Late frames with
   collapsing \(B_{\mathrm{up}}\) are not comparison evidence.

\(\max|j|\) decays from 0.80 because that peak is O-point current,
not a reconnection proxy.

Re-run `coalescence_event.py` on the existing Stage-0 `sheet.json` files with the corrected \(p_X\) definition and execute the common-band field gate before authorizing \(\eta=0.005\).

Do not proceed to \(\eta=0.005\) in this PR. Do not fit a scaling
exponent.
