# Magnetic reconnection diagnostics (issue #26)

Research note for the offline topology/reconnection experiment on
the merged #24 2-D incompressible visco-resistive MHD prototype.
The solver is unchanged.

## Decision

**Slow, converged 2-D resistive reconnection occurs at persistent
X-points during the early well-conditioned evolution. No converged
topology bifurcation or plasmoid event is demonstrated in the later
peak-current regime.**

Restricted to \(\nu=\eta=0.005\), \(t\le 0.80\), 256²/512², one
magnetically enclosed island. Peak \(|j|\) at \(t=2.24\) remains
outside this window.

## Question

At fixed physical parameters and after timestep and spatial
convergence, does the solution exhibit a reproducible magnetic
connectivity change with a rate that topology, electric-field, and
flux diagnostics agree on?

## Model and signs (unchanged from #24)

\[
\mathbf B=(\partial_y a,-\partial_x a),\qquad j=-\nabla^2 a,
\]
\[
E_z=-\partial_t a,\qquad
\partial_t a+\mathbf u\cdot\nabla a=-\eta j.
\]
At a true X-point \(\nabla a=0\), so \(E_z=\eta j\) if \(u=0\) or
\(u\cdot\nabla a=0\) there. That identity is a local Ohm check, not
a reconnection proof.

## Tracker

`scripts/mhd_topology.py` locates \(\nabla a=0\) by bilinear-seeded
Newton, then **evaluates \(a\), \(\nabla a\) and the Hessian at the
converged point from the DFT** (cell-centered phase). Classification
uses that Fourier Hessian (`eig_ratio`, `hess_cond`). \(j=-\nabla^2 a\)
at the point is spectral, not bilinear.

Magnetic connectivity traces the critical level \(a=a_X\) along
\(\mathbf B=(\partial_y a,-\partial_x a)\), not \(\pm\nabla a\).
Four rays come from the Hessian quadratic form
\(\lambda_1\xi_1^2+\lambda_2\xi_2^2=0\) (generally **not** the
eigenvectors). \(\Delta a=a_O-a_X\) is stored only if an
\(a=a_X\) X–X cycle winds around that O.

Morse \(\pm\nabla a\) walks remain a scalar diagnostic. On
\(a=\sin x\sin y\) they run on the diagonals to O-points; magnetic
separatrices are the axes and connect X to X. A test requires both
graphs and fails if they are swapped.

Tracking uses a **physical** gate \(\Delta r \le 2\,\Delta t\)
(VA~\(O(1)\) bound on \([0,2\pi]^2\)), not \(4\Delta x\). The same
translating topology keeps 8 tracks with no birth/death at
\(N=32,64,128\) and \(\Delta t=0.025,0.05,0.10\).

Magnetic connectivity is the \(a=a_X\) contour graph along
\(\mathbf B\): X–X separatrix edges and O enclosure by those
faces. Morse \(\pm\nabla a\) basins are not used as connectivity.
\((n_X,n_O,n_{\mathrm{degen}})\) is only a sentinel.

`halfmax_area_sqrt` is an operational area proxy, **not** a
sheet-axis length. No upstream \(B\) is measured, so no physical
local Lundquist number is reported.

Synthetic tests (`scripts/test_mhd_topology.py`):

* stationary \(\sin x\sin y\): 4 X + 2 O\(_\max\) + 2 O\(_\min\) at
  the exact points; Fourier \(|\nabla a|^2\sim10^{-32}\);
* rigid translation: 8 tracks, no birth/death, X follows
  \((vt,wt)\);
* same motion at three \(N\) and three cadences;
* OT flux: 8 critical points;
* fold creation/annihilation: count changes, births and deaths;
* decaying eigenmode \(e^{-t}\sin x\sin y\): counts fixed, no
  birth/death (false-reconnection control);
* nearest-O trap: Morse walk reaches the far connected O;
* magnetic vs Morse on \(\sin x\sin y\): axes/X–X vs diagonals/X–O,
  at \(N=32,64,128\);
* OT \(t=0\) multigraph: parallel X–X edges and \(\Delta a=\pm 1\).

## Baseline \(\nu=\eta=0.005\)

Source of fields: #24 runs
`/scratch/project_462001519/juaho/mhd2d-23/ot{256,512}_nu0005_peak/`,
`--cfl 0.4`, dumps every \(\Delta t\approx 0.039\).

**X-track \(E_z\) vs \(\eta j\)** (longest X track, 256², full
cadence): they agree to a few parts in \(10^3\) while the Hessian
is well-conditioned (\(t\lesssim 1.4\)). At \(t=1.178\),
\(E_z=5.25\times10^{-2}\), \(\eta j=5.26\times10^{-2}\). Cadence
stride 2 (twice the dump interval) does not change this. Stride 4
(\(\Delta t\sim 0.16\)) shifts \(E_z\) by \(\sim 2\)–\(10\%\).
Repeating 256² at `--cfl 0.2` gives the same \(E_z(t)\) to all
printed digits at \(t=1.178\). The Ohm check is not an artefact of
\(\Delta t\) or of the finest finite difference.

**Hessian degeneracy is Fourier-real and 256/512-agreed.**
Minimum well-conditioned X `hess_cond` at \(t=0.785\) is 10.06063
on both grids. At \(t=0.825\) both report \(n_X=3\),
\(n_{\mathrm{degen}}=1\). By \(t=1.178\) both have \(n_X=0\),
\(n_{\mathrm{degen}}=4\). \(n_O=4\) throughout. Peak \(|j|\) at
\(t=2.238\) is in this degenerate window (\(n_X=2\), cond of the
surviving labelled X \(\approx 12.68\) on both grids; the tracked
long-lived X that still has an \(a_X(t)\) has cond \(\sim 700\)).
This is not a bilinear-interpolation artefact.

**Magnetic connectivity is a multigraph.** Distinct \(a=a_X\)
branches between the same X pair are stored as parallel edges.
Two-edge faces are the OT islands. A simple neighbour graph
missed them and falsely reported no enclosed O.

Analytic OT at \(t=0\): 4 X (\(a=\pm 0.5\)) and 4 O
(\(a=\pm 1.5\)); parallel X–X edges; each \(\mathrm{O}_{\max}\)
(resp. \(\mathrm{O}_{\min}\)) is enclosed by the \(+0.5\)
(resp. \(-0.5\)) network with \(\Delta a=\pm 1\). Tests at
\(N=64,128\) require this.

Through \(t\le 0.80\) both 256² and 512² keep 4 X, 4 O and 8
enclosed faces. \(\Delta a\) is identical. X–X hit *labels* can
swap among equivalent partners; enclosure count does not. No new
magnetic island. That is persistent-X flux transfer, not a
separatrix bifurcation.

**Island flux budget** (one \(a=-0.5\) X with enclosed
\(\mathrm{O}_{\min}\), \(t\in[0,0.80]\)). Definitions:
\(F=a_O-a_X\), \(E_z=-\partial_t a\). At a null \(\nabla a=0\),
so \(\partial_t a=-\eta j\) and \(E_z=\eta j\). Then
\(dF/dt=E_{z,X}-E_{z,O}=\eta(j_X-j_O)\). The first equality is
kinematic once \(E_z\) is \(-\mathrm{d}a/\mathrm{d}t\) along the
track; the independent check is Ohm at both nulls.

| run | \(F(0)\to F(0.785)\) | rel \(\eta(j_X-j_O)\) | \(\langle E_{z,X}\rangle/\langle\dot F\rangle\) |
|-----|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 256² `--cfl 0.4` | \(-1.000\to-0.9786\) | \(5.65\times10^{-4}\) | 0.405 |
| 256² `--cfl 0.2` | same | \(5.65\times10^{-4}\) | 0.405 |
| 512² `--cfl 0.4` | same | \(5.65\times10^{-4}\) | 0.405 |
| 256² stride 2 | same \(F\) | \(2.33\times10^{-3}\) | 0.404 |
| 256² stride 4 | same \(F\) | \(9.87\times10^{-3}\) | 0.406 |
| force-free | \(1\to e^{-2\eta t}\) | \(10^{-5}\) | 0.000 |

OT: about 40% of \(\dot F\) is \(E_{z,X}\) (X-point transfer), 60%
is \(-E_{z,O}\) (O evolution). Force-free: \(E_{z,X}=0\), all of
\(\dot F\) is O-mode decay. Changing \(F\) alone is not
reconnection; the X-point electric field is.

No new X–O pair before degeneracy. After \(t\approx 0.82\) the
X-points are Hessian-degenerate; peak current is not used.

**256 vs 512 Ohm check.** \(E_z(t)\) and \(\eta j_X(t)\) on the
longest X track agree between resolutions to the printed digits.

**Sheet.** FWHM of \(|j|\) at peak remains \(0.12\)–\(0.14\).
`halfmax_area_sqrt` is not used as a Lundquist length.

## Controls

* Force-free \(a=\sin x\sin y\), \(u=0\): 4 X + 4 O persist;
  \(a_X=0\) so \(E_z=\eta j=0\) at saddles; no false reconnection
  rate.
* Decaying synthetic eigenmode: no births/deaths.
* Hydro \(a=0\): no magnetic nulls to track.

## \(\eta=0.0025\)

Not used for a reconnection claim. #24: 512² `--cfl 0.4` was
timestep-limited; 256² is spatially under-resolved. A reconnection
rate there would be numerically unresolved.

## Literature (applicability)

* Orszag & Tang, JFM 90 (1979): this is their incompressible
  vortex. Applies.
* Sweet/Parker: assumes a quasi-steady, isolated current sheet
  with a well-defined inflow and length. OT is a decaying,
  time-dependent vortex; SP scalings are a comparison, not a
  prediction we have tested.
* Loureiro et al. (2007), Huang & Bhattacharjee (2010): plasmoid
  chains at \(S\gtrsim 10^4\). Our local \(S\) is \(O(10^2)\)–\(10^3\).
  The theories do not apply as onset criteria here.
* García Morillo & Alexakis, JFM 1007 (2025) R3: OT plasmoids can
  be under-resolution artefacts; well-resolved spectral OT showed
  none even at much larger \(S\). Used as a **falsification
  baseline**, not a threshold to chase.

## What would be required to flip the decision

* well-conditioned X-points through the claimed event;
* a connectivity diagnostic that is silent on force-free and
  decaying-eigenmode controls, and that agrees between 256² and
  512²;
* \(E_z\), \(\eta j\), and \(d\Delta a/dt\) agreeing on a
  dt- and N-converged interval.

A topology-changing / plasmoid event in the peak-current window is
not demonstrated. Continuous X-point reconnection in \(t\le 0.80\)
is.
