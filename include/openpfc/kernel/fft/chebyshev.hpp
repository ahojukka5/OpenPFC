 * @file chebyshev.hpp
 * @brief FFT-backed Chebyshev transform on a Lobatto grid.
 *
 * Values on x_j = cos(pi j / n) are an even extension of a cosine series.
 * The transform and the first derivative use one ordinary complex FFT of
 * length 2n. The mixed Laplacian differentiates one periodic Fourier
 * direction and this Chebyshev axis on a single rank. Dirichlet
 * Poisson matches both endpoint values. Neumann Poisson matches both
 * endpoint slopes and sets the integral to zero. Dirichlet Helmholtz
 * solves u'' - lambda u = f with those endpoint values. Neumann
 * Helmholtz matches both endpoint slopes. Robin Poisson mixes the
 * value and the slope at each end. Robin Helmholtz uses the same
 * mix for u'' - lambda u = f. A zero lambda reuses the Robin
 * Poisson integral. Dirichlet values on a Fourier × Chebyshev
 * rank reuse the Helmholtz solve with λ = k². Neumann slopes on
 * that rank do the same, and the mean mode keeps the integral
 * gauge. Robin data on that rank mixes the value and the slope
 * with weights that do not vary along x. Helmholtz on that rank
 * adds λ to k² and reuses those weights. A zero λ reuses the
 * Robin Poisson solve. A second periodic direction adds k_y²
 * on that rank. Dirichlet values there reuse the Helmholtz
 * solve with λ = k_x² + k_y². Neumann slopes there do the
 * same, and the mean mode keeps the integral gauge. Robin
 * data there mixes the value and the slope with weights that
 * do not vary on the periodic plane. Helmholtz there adds λ
 * to k_x² + k_y² and reuses those weights. A zero λ reuses
 * the Robin Poisson solve. A channel wall is still a separate
 * step.
 *
 * The FFT plans are created on each call. Do not call these functions
 * concurrently.
